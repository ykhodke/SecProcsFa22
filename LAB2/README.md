# Securing Processor Architectures - Fall 2022 
## Lab 2- Spectre Attacks

Welcome to lab 2!

In this lab we will be putting the Spectre attack into practice against the Linux kernel. You will complete three CTF style problems of increasing difficulty to leak a secret from kernel memory using the cache as a side channel. 

Good luck!
