1.1
    Since the kernel is placing the retreived secrets at 4096*n location in the shared memory the number of chache
    lines to be flushed is equal to ceil(LAB2_SHARED_MEMORY_SIZE/4096)

1.2
    If the attacker and the victim don't have a shared memory the attack won't work as the timing difference in chache
    access is created by the attacker ejecting shared memory lines from the cache. Without shared memory PRIME+PROBE is 
    a better attack vector.

2.1
    In real world attacks the secret value is used in an arithematic operation to create an arbitraily large offset that
    is greater than the shared memory size. Since access violation checks are delayed till the instruction retires, the caching
    mechanism has already generated a foot-print in the heirarchy. Since shared memory is also mapped somehwere in the victim's
    address space an out of bound access might lead to arbitary location in the victim's address space.
